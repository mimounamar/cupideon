# Cupidéon

Cupidéon is a love test made by La Gazette de Léon to bring people together on Valentine's Day. This project allowed 200 students from my school to find love... or laugh when seing who's their perfect match... 


## How does it work?
People answer to some questions. After all the participants complete the form, an algorithm is run to find the perfect matches using Gale-Shapley's algorithm. It also includes an intergration of Google Authentification API.
